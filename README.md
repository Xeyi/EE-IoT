# EE-IoT
[2020-12-10] Completed the project, Using OpenCV to read the image with '.pgm' form. Using sklearn to build a decision tree module, and trained the module with a dataset. Finally, completed the recognizing process.    
:  
[2020-12-03] Work on final project about facial recognizition, inport OpenCV to read the image. Deciding to use Decision Tree as the algorithm.  
:  
[2020-11-26] Implemented Lab 10 B, about IOTA. Installed pyota.  
:  
[2020-11-19] Learn lession 10. Implemented Lab 10 A, learnt SHA-2 Secure Hash Algorithm and try to build the tiniest blockchain in less than 50 lines of Python by Gerald Nash.  
:  
[2020-11-12] Install YANG(pip3 install -U lxml pyang) and PlantUML, learn lab 9A.  
:  
[2020-11-05] Learn sklearn, using sklearn to implement some algorithm and module. Sklearn has so many useful packages, sklearn.model_selection/train_test_split, sklearn.tree /DecisionTreeClassifier, sklearn.metrics/accuracy_score, sklearn.tree, sklearn.preprocessing and so on. Also I worked on Lab 8B to try histograms, box plots, regression, and classification. Also I used cross-validation to check data in titanic table.  
              data_set=pd.read_csv("Titanic.csv")  
              data_set['pclass'] = data_set['pclass'].replace({'1st':1,'2nd':2,'3rd':3}).astype(int)  
              data_set['sex'] = data_set['sex'].replace({'female':0,'male':1}).astype(int)  
              data_set.fillna('0',inplace = True)  
              data_train, data_test = train_test_split(data_set, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 100)  
:  
[2020-10-29] Learn Data Analysis, do Lab 8 A. Install numpy, pandas, matplotlibs and such packages. Numpy can help me to process data in a easy way. Pandas helps me to get a intuitive and easy handling data. Matplotlibs helps to plot a figure that I want, to see how the data change.    
:  
[2020-10-22] Learn MATLAB, do Lab 7 A and B. I'm interesting in face recognition and then find some resource from https://ai.aliyun.com/. Trying to install and run SDK on my Respberry Pi.  
:  
[2020-10-15] Do Lab6 A and B.  Install and login Particle-Agent.   
:  
[2020-10-08] Learn to use Docker, install Docker and run Crossbar.io on different terminals. Learn Mosquitto and Paho, try to publish 'Hello' on another terminal.   
:  
[2020-10-01] Check the lab 4, pip install Django and Django Rest, MariaDB and psutil, Adafruit CircuitPython-DHT library. Try to code the memory game. And make connection to Apache server.  
:  
[2020-09-23] Do lab3, learn Python, use pip to install and upgrade packages in repository. Try sending email by Respberry Pi 4B wiht the provided code.  
:  
[2020-09-16] Do lab2A(GPIO and serial communication), try to control the device by code.  
:  
[2020-09-09] install NOOBS on Raspberry Pi, set the configuration, and download VNC  
:  
[2020-09-03] Reviewed the syllabus, created a Google site with a link to a GitHub repository, and studied the IEEE writing style
